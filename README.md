# Compatability Games
This is a personal project where I work to better my understanding of various programming languages.
The idea is that I write a game in many different languages using a client-server setup
and the goal is to make it so that they can all interact at once.
For example, the server can be run using the Java version and the clients that connect are a 
Python version and a C++ version, but everything works as intended.

Network protocols for each game are found in a README in each game's folder.
The protocols are uniform across each language.
